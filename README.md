## What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did
## you take this class?

I decided on CS when I was a senior in high-school. I took a computer science class and became more interested. I was interested in computers since I was a kid and have further realized my interest in the subject. This class I took because I am working as a software developer and am often working with web apps or applications that interface with websites. 
## What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?

My ideal career is software development involving machine learning with autonomous vehicles. I am open to any software development field and have started a new job as of last October in the field of development within cybersecurity. I see my career focusing on software development in general, and later on going into development for an auto manufacturer or ai company. 

## What programming experience do you have? 
## Do you have any web experience?

	I have programming experience primarily with Java, Python, SQL, GO, Power-shell. I have some minor experience with javascript. I have experience with applications written in python that interface with a SQL Database and create json outputs, as well as java apps that have this functionality as well.
